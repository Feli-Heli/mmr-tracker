#Majora's Mask Randomizer Item Tracker

Web based item tracker with map tracking for Majora's Mask randomizer based on testrunnersrl's Oot item tracker!

Go here to check it out: https://feli-heli.github.io/mmr-tracker/

Changes to V1.1:

The tracker has been updated to include several common tricks that can be toggled on/off to change logic!

Default logic has been updated, and now better represents the default logic of the randomizer.

Optional checks can now be viewed (only Cows right now, but more will be added in the future).

Some smaller bugfixes to the item tracker, including adding the correct number of bottles.
